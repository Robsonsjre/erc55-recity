<details>
<summary>SQL Starter</summary>

```sql
SELECT
    contract_address,
    COUNT(*) as transfer_count
FROM erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer
WHERE evt_block_time > CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY contract_address
ORDER BY transfer_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```
</details>

### Exercise 3.2: Dune - DEX Volume (Medium)

**Objective**: Compare Uniswap vs Sushiswap daily volume for the last 30 days

**Tasks**:
1. Use the `dex.trades` table
2. Filter for Uniswap and Sushiswap
3. Group by day and project
4. Calculate daily volume in USD
5. Create a visualization

---

### Exercise 3.3: The Graph - Simple Subgraph (Hard)

**Objective**: Create a subgraph to index a specific NFT collection

**Tasks**:
1. Choose an NFT collection (e.g., BAYC, Azuki)
2. Define schema with entities: Collection, NFT, Transfer, Owner
3. Write mapping handlers for Transfer events
4. Deploy to Subgraph Studio

## Comparison Challenges

### Challenge 1: Speed Test (Medium)

   - The Graph (per query)
2. Estimate monthly cost for:
   - 1M queries
   - 10M queries
   - 100M queries

**Expected Output**: Cost comparison matrix

### Challenge 3: Real-time Dashboard (Hard)

## Advanced Challenges

### Challenge 4: Multi-method Pipeline (Expert)

**Objective**: Build a data pipeline using all three methods

**Tasks**:
1. Use **Event Filters** to monitor real-time transfers
2. Use **Dune** to analyze historical patterns
3. Use **The Graph** to maintain a database of known whales
4. Combine data to identify: new whales, whale clusters, patterns

**Expected Output**: Comprehensive whale tracking system

---

### Challenge 5: Custom Analytics Tool (Expert)

**Objective**: Build a complete analytics tool

**Requirements**:
- Real-time monitoring (Event Filters or WebSocket)
- Historical analysis (Dune or The Graph)
- Data export (CSV, JSON)
- Alerting system
- Web UI (optional)

**Example Use Cases**:
- Token holder analytics
- DEX trading patterns
- NFT collection statistics
- Protocol TVL tracking

**Expected Output**: Production-ready analytics tool

## Bonus: Debug Challenges

### Debug 1: Fix the Bug (Easy)

This code has a bug. Find and fix it:

```javascript
const transfers = await provider.getLogs({
  address: tokenAddress,
  topics: [
    ethers.utils.id('Transfer(address,address,uint256)'),
    senderAddress  // BUG: Missing padding
  ],
  fromBlock: currentBlock,
  toBlock: currentBlock - 1000  // BUG: Wrong order
})
```

---

### Debug 2: Optimize the Query (Medium)

This Dune query is slow. Optimize it:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE value > 1000000000000000000
  AND "to" IN (
    SELECT contract_address FROM tokens.erc20
  )
```

**Hint**: Missing time filter, SELECT *, inefficient subquery
